- 👋 Hi there, I’m Yassine and I am a geomatics engineering masters student at UPV.
- 👀 I’m currently interested in improving my programming skills in different environments such as python, java, javascript in order to build applications for various fields (Data science, machine learning, GIS software development etc.) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development, data structures, database administration, data analytics, machine learning algorithms etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating in projects where I could put my knowledge to the test and keep improving through this learning process.
- 📫 contact me via email: yassinea19@gmail.com
