- 👋 Hi there, I’m Yassine and I am a geomatics engineering masters student at UPV.
- 👀 I’m currently interested in improving my programming skills in different environments such as python, java, javascript in order to build applications for various fields (Data science, machine learning, GIS development etc.) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development, data structures, database administration, data analytics, machine learning algorithms etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I could put all my knowledge to the test and keep improving through this learning process.
- 📫 contact me via email: yassinea19@gmail.com
